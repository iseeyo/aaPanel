History:

The founding R & D team of BaoTa has 5 people, all of whom have 5 to 10 years of experience in idc related industries. When everyone discusses together and works in the schedule or their own use, they find that there is no such thing in the field of servers. The company specializes in developing relevant software for ordinary users, especially those who do not know much about technology. We found that for many users, operating the server is not easy, it is necessary to consult others, take time to search for answers, and even pay for simple questions. There will be many pits involved in the cost. Some auxiliary software itself is more difficult than using the server. Even this kind of painful point is itchiness. With the development of cloud servers, the number of server users has increased by several orders of magnitude. The preparatory work for the establishment of the pagoda began at the end of 2014, and began to develop and test software in the first half of 2015. At this stage, the pagoda brand was officially launched in 2016 and bt.cn was used as the official website.

In 2017, BaoTa tried to enter the overseas market, but because the number of people could not keep up, he decided to temporarily abandon the overseas market and focus on China.

In 2019, due to the gradual growth of BaoTa users, which has become the hosting control panel used by the most webmasters in China, it is decided to enter the overseas market and develop related plug-ins that are suitable for foreign friends
